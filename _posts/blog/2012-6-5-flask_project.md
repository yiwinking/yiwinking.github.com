###project EMU is for train ticket_booking , I have done this project with java before, now I change it to python with Flask 

###Part One : database tables

##### their are five tables , `Admin` is for admin to manage the system; `user` is for user to sign in  and register his accounts; `Train` is for train information, such as `train ID`, `volume`,`train type`,`train number`; table `Ticket` is for  info of tickets ,such as `ticket ID`, `start Date` , `end Date`, `start place` , `end Place` ,`price`, `seat number`,`train ID`; `User_booked_ticket` is for making user's booking tickets, such as `train ID` and `ticket ID`

###part Two : create a project 

to install flask if we don't have. 

` sudo easy_install virtualenv`

#####cerate and active its environmentï¼š

`mkdir emu`,`cd emu`,`virtualenv env` , the use ` . env/bin/activate` to active. and finally , use `easy_install Flask` to install flask in this ENV.


----------------------------------------------


###Part Three : add code.

#####create  file named "emu.py",

we need these Plug-in: 

`flask_mail` for sending emails;

`flask_principal` for managing permissions;

`flask_uploads` for uploading file;

`flask_wtf` for preventing duplicate submissions of the form(named "CSRF"?) and recaptcha.

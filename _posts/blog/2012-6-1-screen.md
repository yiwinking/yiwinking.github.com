When we SSH to remote servers to do sth and it may takes long ,or we need to run at least two commands , `screen` is a good stuff to help us to save time.

###### screen command :

`screen -S winking_screen` -> create a screen session named "winking_screen" 

`screen -ls` -> list all current sessions

`screen -r winking_screen` -> turn back to winking_screen

`screen -d winking_screen` -> detach winking_screen

`screen -d -r winking_screen` -> stop current session and turn back to winking_screen

`Ctrl-A d` logout of current screen.


---------------------------


######first login remote server and create a screen session.

`screen`

######do sth you want

such as `ruby do_sth_you_want.rb`

######logout
 
`exit` or  `Ctrl-A d`

######relink to the working screen 

first we can use `screen -ls` to see which screen we need
.

then use `screen -r screen_you_need` to login .
